## üìù Introduction

This device helps users maintain good sitting posture in learning and working environments, while also acting as a Pomodoro timer. It uses built-in accelerometer and gyroscope sensors on the Arduino Nano BLE 33 for data collection and posture classification via a neural network model deployed at the edge.

**Key Features:**
- Real-time posture monitoring and feedback (LEDs + vibration)
- Pomodoro timer with posture awareness
- No need for expensive force/pressure sensors integrated in the chair
- Edge ML model deployment using Edge Impulse

## üìö Research Questions

1. How to use embedded devices and IMU sensors (acceleration/gyroscope) for posture detection and deploy ML models?
2. How to extend device features after achieving accurate posture detection (e.g., Pomodoro timer)?

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Application Overview

- **Data Collection:** Uses Arduino Nano BLE 33's built-in accelerometer and gyroscope.
- **Model Training:** Custom dataset with 4 posture labels (Bad, Upright, Stand_Up, Sit_Down), trained with Edge Impulse.
- **Deployment:** Model exported as TensorFlow Lite, runs on Arduino Nano BLE 33.
- **Feedback:** NeoPixel LEDs (green = good, red = bad, yellow = standing), vibration motor alert.

## üóÇÔ∏è Dataset

- 6-axis IMU data (acceleration + gyroscope, 3 axes each)
- 4 posture classes, 260 samples, 2000ms per sample (~10 min total)
- Data collected from multiple users for feature diversity
- Magnetic induction sensor disabled to ensure IMU purity

## ü§ñ Model & Experiments

The selected neural network architecture:

- Input: 78 features (from IMU)
- Two Dense layers (32 and 16 neurons), Dropout(0.3), Output(4 classes)
- Compared different architectures:
  - 78√ó32√ó16√ó4 (best: high accuracy and generalization, F1=0.96)
  - 78√ó20√ó10√ó4 (slightly lower train accuracy, but strong F1=0.98)
  - 78√ó32√ó16√ó8√ó4 (overly deep, led to poor performance)
- Optimized for edge deployment: lightweight, efficient, robust

- **Best Model:** 91.1% test precision, F1=0.96
- **Generalization:** No significant overfitting, high validation accuracy
- **Finding:** Shallow networks with more neurons per layer are better for low-dimensional IMU data

## üöÄ Future Work

- Try different optimizers (Adam, SGD, etc.)
- Explore classifier structures for more complex datasets
- Investigate deeper networks with richer sensor data
